# PhobosPlusPlus (Phobos++)
Phobos++ is a really bad continuation of the original Phobos Client specifically version 1.9.0 so technically its Phobos 2.0.0 but I guess thats 3arthh4ck. This adds a few modules, fixes the trash burrow and optimizes it for people with 3 billion ping like myself though I would still recommend you use 3arthh4ck since it is probably the best coded client ever.

## How to build
Windows
```bat
gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
gradlew build
```
